ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KavyaSeelam2004
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full stack development, with a particular focus on creating seamless and efficient web applications.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning front-end development, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and responsive user interfaces.

This portfolio project is a culmination of my journey in web development, showcasing the projects 
I've worked on, the skills I've acquired, and my passion for coding. As I continue to expand my knowledge 
in both front-end and back-end technologies, this portfolio will evolve to reflect my growth as a developer.
